  <h2>how to play</h2>
  <br>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(1/4)</span> join a lobby</h3>
    <p>enter a nickname and choose one of four possible lobbies to play in: <span style="color:chocolate;">olympia</span>, <span style="color:chocolate;">corinth</span> (60-), <span style="color:chocolate;">athens</span> (45-30), or <span style="color:chocolate;">sparta</span> (15-15).</p>
    <p>lobbies restrict the amount of time you have to <span style="color: skyblue;">pick heroes</span> and to <span style="color: skyblue;">play your turn</span>.</p>
    <p>heroes are randomly assigned to teams in <span style="color:chocolate;">olympia</span>, and turns are untimed. assigned teams will have at least one fighter class and at least one healer class.</p>
    <p><span style="color:chocolate;">corinth</span> gives 60 seconds to pick heroes, and turns are untimed.</p>
    <p><span style="color: chocolate;">athens</span> gives 45 seconds to pick heroes and 30 seconds per turn.</p>
    <p><span style="color:chocolate;">sparta</span> gives 15 seconds to pick heroes and 15 seconds per turn.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(2/4)</span> pick your heroes</h3>
    <p>pick up to five hero cards by clicking in the <span style="color:cyan;">index</span> to bring a card into your <span style="color: cyan;">deck</span>.</p>
    <p>you can view hero details by hovering over any card with your mouse, and you can click on any card in your deck to return it to the index.</p>
    <p>there are seven available hero classes: <span style="color:palevioletred;">melee</span> and <span style="color:palevioletred;">ranged</span> fighters, <span style="color:palevioletred;">protectors</span> and <span style="color:palevioletred;">healers</span>, <span style="color:palevioletred;">supporters</span> and <span style="color:palevioletred;">casters</span>, and <span style="color:palevioletred;">special</span> heroes.</p>
    <p>classes can be <a href="/preview" target="_blank" style="color: gray; text-decoration: underline;">previewed</a> at any time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span style="color:palevioletred;">melee</span> and <span style="color:palevioletred;">ranged</span> fighters tend to have higher <span style="color: fuchsia;">attack</span> (ATK) and primarily do damage through autoattacks and abilities.</p></li>
      <li><p><span style="color:palevioletred;">protectors</span> focus on absorbing damage or increasing the <span style="color: fuchsia;">defense</span> (DEF) of allies, while the main purpose of <span style="color: palevioletred;">healers</span> is to restore allies' <span style="color: fuchsia;">health points</span> (HP).</p></li>
      <li><p><span style="color:palevioletred;">supporters</span> boost allies' stats and bestow various blessings, while <span style="color:palevioletred;">casters</span> impair enemies and worsen enemy stats.</li>
      <li><p><span style="color:palevioletred;">special</span> heroes use unique abilities to affect the outcome of the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>if you haven't picked any heroes when the allotted time is up, you and your opponent will be returned to the lobby.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(3/4)</span> move your hero</h3>
    <p>each player has two turns per round.</p>
    <p>on your turn, click one of your <span style="color: dodgerblue;">tokens&nbsp;</span>on the map to move it, and click again to place it.</p>
    <p><i>note that clicking the same tile again will keep the token in the same position for the turn. to unselect a tile, press <span style="color:limegreen;">c</span> instead.</i></p>
    <p>the maximum distance that you can move the token depends on the hero's <span style="color: fuchsia;">movement</span> (MVT) stat.</p>
    <p>at any point, you can press <span style="color:limegreen;">z</span> and <span style="color:limegreen;">x</span> to decrease/increase the <span style="color: dodgerblue;"> preview radius</span>, which appears when you hover your cursor over a game tile.</p>
    <p>the preview radius can be useful as a tool for measuring tile distances on the grid.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(4/4)</span> autoattack, use your ability, or use your ultimate</h3>
    <p>the hero's autoattack will attack all opponents within their <span style="color: fuchsia;">reach&nbsp;</span>(RC).</p>
    <p>each hero also has a unique <span style="color:tomato;">ability</span> consuming 200 <span style="color: fuchsia;">mana points</span> (MP), and an <span style="color:tomato;">ultimate</span> consuming 1000 MP.</p>
    <p>all heroes gain a certain amount of MP after each turn, and generally can accumulate up to 1000 MP.</p>
    <p>in addition to an ability and an ultimate, each hero has a&nbsp;<span style="color: tomato;">passive</span> skill that is automatically applied each turn.</p>
    <p>ability, ultimate, and passive descriptions can be <a href="/preview" target="_blank" style="color: gray; text-decoration: underline;">previewed</a> at any time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3>damaging opponents</h3>
    <p>the base amount of damage done is usually calculated with the hero's ATK divided by their opponent's DEF.</p>
    <p>there are six status effects that modify the base amount of damage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>charmed:</i> the hero's DEF is reduced by 50%.</li>
        <li><i>distracted:</i> the hero is prevented from gaining MP, and DEF is reduced by 25%.</li>
        <li><i>poisoned:</i> the hero will obtain 800/DEF damage each turn.</li>
        <li><i>stunned:</i> the hero's ATK and MVT are reduced to zero, and RC is reduced to one.</li>
        <li><i>terrified:</i> the hero's ATK is reduced by 50%.</li>
        <li><i>obscured:</i> the hero's location is not visible to the opponent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>as an example, a terrified hero with ATK=2000 would deal (2000/10)/2=100 HP of damage to a hero with DEF=10.</p>
    <p>status effects typically persist for 4 turns; repeated applications will stack by duration. status effects can be removed by certain heroes.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">true</span> damage is applied directly and is not affected by hero stats or statuses.</p>
    <p>heroes are defeated when their HP reaches zero. a hero's passive becomes inactive once they are defeated.</p>
    <p>mythomagic is won when all enemy heroes have been defeated, or when your opponent concedes.</p>

    <h3>creating an account</h3>
    <p>if you have an <span style="color: violet;">invitation code</span>, you can create an account.</p>
    <p>your account <span style="color: violet;">username</span> reserves a nickname for your usage and assigns you an invitation code that can be used up to five times.</p>
    <p>please <b>do not create multiple accounts</b> to gain more invitation codes: your account (and all resulting accounts) will eventually be removed.</p>
    <p>accounts track your wins and losses across games and calculate your player score, which is used to determine your class and ranking.</p>
    <p>your player score is initialized to be <span style="color: greenyellow;">10.00.</span></p>
    <p>winning a game against a logged-in player grants you 1 point plus 10% of your opponent's score; surrendering a game after pick phase completes counts as a win towards your opponent.</p>
    <p>if a player is logged in, their name in the lobby will have an asterisk (*) with a color denoting their current class.</p>
    <p><span style="color: violet;">classes</span> are assigned based on your score: <span style="color: goldenrod;">iron</span>, <span style="color: goldenrod;">bronze</span> (>15.00), <span style="color: goldenrod;">silver</span> (>20.00), <span style="color: goldenrod;">gold</span> (>30.00), <span style="color: goldenrod;">grandmaster</span> (>40.00).</p>
