  <h2>how to play</h2>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(1/4)</span> join a lobby</h3>
    <p>enter a nickname and choose one of four possible lobbies to play in: <span style="color:chocolate;">corinth</span> (60-), <span style="color:chocolate;">athens</span> (45-30), <span style="color:chocolate;">olympia</span> (30-20), or <span style="color:chocolate;">sparta</span> (10-10).</p>
    <p>lobbies restrict the amount of time you have to <span style="color: dodgerblue;">pick a hero</span> and to <span style="color: dodgerblue;">play your turn</span>.</p>
    <p>games of mythomagic played in <span style="color:chocolate;">corinth</span> have a pick phase of 60 seconds and untimed turns.</p>
    <p><span style="color: chocolate;">athens</span> is recommended for most games and gives 45 seconds to pick a hero and 25 seconds on each of your turns.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(2/4)</span> choose which heroes to play</h3>
    <p>pick up to five hero cards by clicking in the <span style="color:darkcyan;">index</span> to bring a card into your <span style="color: darkcyan;">deck</span>.</p>
    <p>you can view hero details by hovering over any card with your mouse, and you can click on any card in your deck to remove it.</p>
    <p>if you haven't picked any heroes by the time that the pick phase completes, you and your opponent will be returned to the lobby.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(3/4)</span> select a hero token and move it</h3>
    <p>each player has two turns per round.</p>
    <p>on your turn, click one of your <span style="color: dodgerblue;">tokens&nbsp;</span>on the map to move it, and click again to place it.</p>
    <p>the maximum distance that you can move the token depends on the hero's <span style="color: fuchsia;">movement</span> (MVT) stat.</p>
    <p>at any point, you can press <span style="color:green;">z</span> and <span style="color:green;">x</span> to decrease/increase the <span style="color: dodgerblue;"> preview radius</span>, which appears when you hover your cursor over a game tile.</p>
    <p>the preview radius can be useful as a tool for measuring tile distances on the grid.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3><span style="color: gray;">(4/4)</span> autoattack, use your ability, or use your ultimate</h3>
    <p>the hero's autoattack will attack all opponents within their <span style="color: fuchsia;">reach&nbsp;</span>(RC).</p>
    <p>each hero also has a unique <span style="color:tomato;">ability</span> consuming 200 <span style="color: fuchsia;">mana points</span> (MP), and an <span style="color:tomato;">ultimate</span> consuming 1000 MP.</p>
    <p>all heroes gain a certain amount of MP after each round, and generally can accumulate up to 1000 MP.</p>
    <p>in addition to an ability and an ultimate, each hero has a&nbsp;<span style="color: tomato;">passive</span> skill that is automatically applied each turn.</p>
    <p>ability, ultimate, and passive descriptions can be previewed <a href="/preview" target="_blank" style="color: gray; text-decoration: underline;">here</a> at any time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="helpSlide">
    <h3>damaging opponents</h3>
    <p>the base amount of damage done is usually calculated with the hero's <span style="color: fuchsia;">attack</span> (ATK) divided by their opponent's <span style="color: fuchsia;">defense</span> (DEF).</p>
    <p>there are six status effects that modify the base amount of damage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>charmed:</i> the hero's DEF is reduced to 1.</li>
        <li><i>distracted:</i> the hero is prevented from gaining MP, and DEF is reduced by 25%.</li>
        <li><i>poisoned:</i> the hero will obtain 500/DEF damage each turn.</li>
        <li><i>stunned:</i> the hero's ATK and MVT are reduced to zero, and RC is reduced to one.</li>
        <li><i>terrified:</i> the hero's ATK is reduced by 50%.</li>
        <li><i>obscured:</i> the hero's location is not visible to the opponent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>as an example, a terrified hero with ATK=2000 would deal (2000/10)/2=100 HP of damage to a hero with DEF=10.</p>
    <p>status effects typically persist for 4 turns; repeated applications will stack by duration. status effects can be removed by certain heroes.</p>
    <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">true</span> damage is applied directly and is not affected by hero stats or statuses.</p>
    <p>heroes are defeated when their HP reaches zero. a hero's passive becomes inactive once they are defeated.</p>
    <p>mythomagic is won when all enemy heroes have been defeated, or when your opponent concedes.</p>
