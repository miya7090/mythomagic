  <h3>pick phase: choose which heroes to play</h3>
  <p>pick up to five hero cards by clicking in the <span style="color:dodgerblue;">index</span> to bring a card into your <span style="color: dodgerblue;">deck</span>.</p>
  <p>you can view hero details by hovering over any card with your mouse.</p>
  <p>while the <span style="color: dodgerblue;">pick phase</span> is ongoing, you can click on any card in your deck to remove it, or press <span style="color:green;">c</span>.</p>
  <p>if you haven't picked any heroes by the time that the pick phase completes, you and your opponent will be returned to the lobby.</p>
  <h3>your turn: select a hero token and move it</h3>
  <p>click one of your <span style="color: dodgerblue;">tokens&nbsp;</span>on the map to move it, and click again to place it.</p>
  <p>the maximum distance that you can move the token depends on the hero's <span style="color: dodgerblue;">movement</span> (MVT) stat.</p>
  <p>at any point, you can press <span style="color:green;">z</span> and <span style="color:green;">x</span> to decrease/increase your <span style="color: dodgerblue;"> preview radius.</span></p>
  <p>the preview radius acts as a tool for measuring tile distances on the grid, when you hover your cursor over a game tile.</p>
  <p>in <span style="color: dodgerblue;">timed</span> mythomagic, you have a limited amount of time in which to complete your turn.</p>
  <h3>choose an action: autoattack, use your ability, or use your ultimate</h3>
  <p>the hero's autoattack will attack all opponents within their <span style="color: dodgerblue;">reach&nbsp;</span>(RC).</p>
  <p>each hero has a unique ability, costing 200 <span style="color: dodgerblue;">mana points</span> (MP), and an ultimate costing 1000 MP.</p>
  <p>all heroes gain MP after each round. autoattacks grant extra MP to the character.</p>
  <p>in addition to an ability and an ultimate, each hero has a&nbsp;<span style="color: dodgerblue;">passive</span> that is automatically applied each turn.</p>
  <p>ability, ultimate, and passive details can be viewed in a card's description.</p>
  <h3>damaging opponents</h3>
  <p>the base amount of damage done is calculated by the hero's ATK divided by their opponent's DEF.</p>
  <p>there are six status effects that modify the base amount of damage:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>charmed: the hero's DEF is reduced to 1, causing the base amount of damage to scale solely with ATK.</li>
      <li>distracted: the hero is prevented from gaining MP, and DEF is reduced by 25%.</li>
      <li>poisoned: the hero will obtain 500/DEF damage each turn.</li>
      <li>stunned: the hero's ATK and MVT are reduced to zero, and RC is reduced to one.</li>
      <li>terrified: the hero's ATK is reduced by 50%.</li>
      <li>obscured: the hero's location is not visible to the opponent.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>status effects can be removed by certain abilities.</p>
  <p>some heroes have <span style="color: dodgerblue;">immunities</span> to certain status effects.</p>
  <p>example: a terrified hero with ATK=2000 would deal (2000/10)/2=100 HP of damage to a hero with DEF=10.</p>
  <p><span style="color: dodgerblue;">true</span> damage is never affected by hero stats or statuses.</p>
  <p>heroes are defeated when their HP reaches zero. defeated heroes can no longer be played in game, and their <span style="color: dodgerblue;">passives</span> become inactive.</p>
  <p>mythomagic is won when all enemy heroes are defeated, or your opponent concedes.</p>
