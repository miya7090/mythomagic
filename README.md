### how to add a new card
1. add an icon or ensure an icon already exists in `public/images/portraits`
2. add hero entry to BASE_STAT_DICT in `config.js`
3. update any relevant group lists (e.g. OLYMPIAN_LIST) in `config.js`
4. update ABILITY_MAP and ULT_MAP in `abilities.js`, and add functions for the ability and ultimate in the same file
5. add the passive function to `passives.js`, or if locating the passive function elsewhere, denote location at top of `passives.js` and comment a label next to the code's actual location
6. test that the ability, ultimate, and passive all function correctly
7. open a pull request and ask for the mongoDB `heroboard` database to be updated
